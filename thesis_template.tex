% NAME OF ACADEMIC UNIT
%
% The following two commands allow you to specify the academic unit you belong to.
% This will appear on the title page as
% ``<academic unit> of <department>''.
% So if you are in the division of biomedical engineering you would need to do:
% \department{Biomedical Engineering}
% \academicunit{Division}
%
% The default is ``Department of Computer Science'' if these commands
% are not given.
%
% If you are in a discipline other than Computer Science, uncomment the following line and
% specify your discipline/department.  Default is 'Computer Science'.
% \department{If not Computer Science, put the name of your department here}

% If you are not in a department, but say, a division, uncomment the following line.
% \academicunit{Put the type of academic unit you belong to here, e.g. Division, College}


% PERMISSION TO USE ADDRESS
%
% If you are not in Comptuer Science you will want to change the

% ABSTRACT
\abstract{
Home advantage in professional sports is a widely accepted phenomenon despite the lack of any controlled experiments at the professional level. The return to play of professional sports during the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique opportunity to analyze the hypothesized effect of home advantage in neutral settings. While recent work has examined the effect of COVID-19 restrictions on home advantage in European football, comparatively few studies have examined the effect of restrictions in the North American professional sports leagues. In this work, we infer the effect of and changes in home advantage prior to and during COVID-19 in the professional North American leagues for hockey, basketball, baseball, and American football. We propose a Bayesian multilevel regression model that infers the effect of home advantage while accounting for relative team strengths. We also demonstrate that the Negative Binomial distribution is the most appropriate likelihood to use in modelling North American sports leagues as they are prone to overdispersion in their points scored. We further demonstrate that multilevel regression provides better model fit to the datasets considered in this thesis as compared to traditional regression modelling and simple averaging often employed in related work. Our model gives strong evidence that home advantage was negatively impacted in the NHL and NBA during their strongly restricted COVID-19 playoffs, while the MLB and NFL showed little to no change during their weakly restricted COVID-19 seasons.

\chapter{Co-Authorship Statement}
Portions of this thesis were published in \cite{Higgs2021}. I collected the data, carried out the experiments, and jointly conceived of the experiments. To remain consistent with wording used in \cite{Higgs2021} I have elected to use the third person ``we" opposed to the first person ``I" for the abstract and main body of the thesis.

% Since thesis chapters are very long and there are a lot of them, it is recommended
% that you put each chapter in a separate .tex file and \input each one of them
% in order.  For example:
%
% \input chap1.tex
% \input chap2.tex
% ...

% The \input command inserts contents of the specified file at the point of the command.
