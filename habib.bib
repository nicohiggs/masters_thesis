abstract = {The home advantage is a robust phenomenon that occurs in the world of amateur and professional sport. Athletic teams have been shown to win significantly more games in their home venue as compared to their opponents' venue. Studies have suggested that the home advantage may be related to familiarity with the facility, increased crowd density and even pre-competition hormonal levels. The present study investigated pre-competition physiological and psychological states of elite hockey players in the home and away venues. Physiological measures included salivary cortisol and testosterone, which were assessed using enzyme immunoassays. In addition, pre-competition psychological states were assessed using the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2. Physiological measures indicated that the players had significantly higher pre-game testosterone when playing in their home venue as compared to their opponents' venue (t(13) = 2.29, p = 0.04); however, this difference was not due to a pre-game rise in testosterone while competing at home. Furthermore, players showed a trend toward higher pre-game cortisol when playing in their home venue (t(13) = 1.96, p = 0.07). Psychological measures indicated that players were more self-confident when playing in their home venue (t(13) = 2.8, p = 0.008) and also had higher somatic (t(13) = 2.3, p = 0.02) and cognitive anxiety (t(13) = 1.87, p = 0.04) when playing in their opponents' venue. The present study supports the notion that there are differences in pre-competition hormonal and psychological states that may play a key role in the 'home advantage'. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Home advantage is quantitatively defined and calculated for each season since the start of the main professional sports in North America and England. Over 400,000 games are analysed. The leagues represented are the National League (1876-2002) and American League (1901-2002) for baseball, the National Hockey League (1917-2003) for ice hockey, the National Football League (1933-2002) for American football, the National Basketball Association (1946-2003) for basketball, and the four levels of professional football, formerly called the Football League, in England (1888-2003). Problems caused by unbalanced playing schedules are considered. The results are presented graphically to show long-term trends and sudden changes. The highest levels of home advantage for all sports were in their early years of existence. Home advantage in ice hockey, basketball and football in England has declined over the last two decades. In baseball there has been very little change over the last 100 years, with home advantage consistently lower than in other sports. There was a large drop in home advantage in football in England following the 7-year suspension of the league during the Second World War. The trends and changes provide some evidence that travel and familiarity contribute to home advantage, but little in support of crowd effects. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor {\&} Francis Group Ltd.},

The present study is unique in that it includes different sports analysed in the same country, at the same level of competition, and over the same time period. Nine team sports from Spain were included: baseball, basketball, handball, indoor soccer, roller hockey, rugby, soccer, volleyball, and water polo. Data for five seasons (2005-2006 to 2009-2010) were obtained, totaling 9,472 games. The results confirmed the existence of home advantage in all nine sports. There was a statistically significant difference between the sports; home advantage was highest in rugby (67.0{\%}), and lowest in volleyball (55.7{\%}), water polo (56.2{\%}), and roller hockey (58.3{\%}). The design of the study controlled for some of the likely causes of home advantage, and the results suggested that the high home advantage for rugby was likely a reflection of the continuous, aggressive, and intense nature of the sport. {\textcopyright} Perceptual and Motor Skills 2011.},

Results Compared to games decided in regulation, higher quality home teams' odds of winning were slightly lower when games concluded in either overtime or the shootout. Further, regardless of team quality, home teams' odds of winning were moderately lower when games concluded in the shootout rather than overtime. Conclusions The shootout may affect home team players' psychological and behavioural states, generally resulting in a decrease in home teams' odds of winning in the shootout relative to overtime.},

This restart, with no new travel by teams, provided a natural experiment whereby the impact of travel and home-court advantage could be systematically examined. We show here that in the pre-COVID-19 regular season, traveling across time zones reduces winning percentage, team shooting accuracy, and turnover percentage, whereas traveling in general reduces offensive rebounding and increases the number of points the opposing (home) team scores. Moreover, we demonstrate that competition in a scenario where no teams travel (restart bubble) reduces the typical effects of travel and home-court advantage on winning percentage, shooting accuracy, and rebounding. Thus, home-court advantage in professional basketball appears to be linked with the away team's impaired shooting accuracy (i.e., movement precision) and rebounding, which may be separately influenced by either circadian disruption or the general effect of travel, as these differences manifest differently when teams travel within or across multiple time zones.},

abstract = {This article develops a predictive model for National Football League (NFL) game scores using data from the period 1988–1993. The parameters of primary interest—measures of team strength—are expected to vary over time. Our model accounts for this source of variability by modeling football outcomes using a state-space model that assumes team strength parameters follow a first-order autoregressive process. Two sources of variation in team strengths are addressed in our model; week-to-week changes in team strength due to injuries and other random factors, and season-to-season changes resulting from changes in personnel and other longer-term factors. Our model also incorporates a home-field advantage while allowing for the possibility that the magnitude of the advantage may vary across teams. The aim of the analysis is to obtain plausible inferences concerning team strengths and other model parameters, and to predict future game outcomes. Iterative simulation is used to obtain samples from the joint posterior distribution of all model parameters. Our model appears to outperform the Las Vegas “betting line” on a small test set consisting of the last 110 games of the 1993 NFL season. {\textcopyright} 1998 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

However, most of this work has concentrated on a single sport, and the development of meaningful cross-sport comparisons has been impeded by the difficulty of translating luck from one sport to another. In this manuscript we develop Bayesian state-space models using betting market data that can be uniformly applied across sporting organizations to better understand the role of randomness in game outcomes. These models can be used to extract estimates of team strength, the between-season, within-season and game-to-game variability of team strengths, as well each team's home advantage. We implement our approach across a decade of play in each of the National Football League (NFL), National Hockey League (NHL), National Basketball Association (NBA) and Major League Baseball (MLB), finding that the NBA demonstrates both the largest dispersion in talent and the largest home advantage, while the NHL and MLB stand out for their relative randomness in game outcomes. We conclude by proposing new metrics for judging competitiveness across sports leagues, both within the regular season and using traditional postseason tournament formats. Although we focus on sports, we discuss a number of other situations in which our generalizable models might be usefully applied.},

abstract = {In wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, 2019-2020 soccer seasons across the world were postponed and eventually made up during the summer months of 2020. Researchers from a variety of disciplines jumped at the opportunity to compare the rescheduled games, played in front of empty stadia, to previous games, played in front of fans. To date, most of this post-Covid soccer research has used linear regression models, or versions thereof, to estimate potential changes to the home advantage. But because soccer outcomes are non-linear, we argue that leveraging the Poisson distribution would be more appropriate. We begin by using simulations to show that bivariate Poisson regression reduces absolute bias when estimating the home advantage benefit in a single season of soccer games, relative to linear regression, by almost 85 percent. Next, with data from 17 professional soccer leagues, we extend bivariate Poisson models estimate the change in home advantage due to games being played without fans. In contrast to current research that overwhelmingly suggests a drop in the home advantage, our findings are mixed; in some leagues, evidence points to a decrease, while in others, the home advantage may have risen. Altogether, this suggests a more complex causal mechanism for the impact of fans on sporting events.},
